% Place at top of document. It should be the first thing.

%       \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}

% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document
% as a title. Likewise, a picture could be included:
%
%   \makeheading[{\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{my_picture}}]{Your Name}
